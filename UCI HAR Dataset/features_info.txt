Feature Selection (for raw data)
================================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Units for all acceleration variables = standard gravity unit 'g'
Units for gyroscope variable = radians/second

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Auto-regression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

Features of the tidy data set
==============================

- The training(X_train.txt and y_train.txt), test(X_test.txt and y_test.txt) and subject(subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt) data were merged together and ordered by subject. 
- Appropriate column names were given for the added columns. 
- y_train.txt and y_test.txt contain activity labels which are numeric. These labels are specified in activity_labels.txt. These were converted into their respective descriptive names.
- The mean() and std()[Standard deviation] measurements for each variable was extracted from the data in the previous step.
- The average of these measurements was taken for each subject, performing each activity specified in activity_labels.txt.
- Thus, the final tidy data set contains the average of mean() and std() measurements for each variable, grouped first by subject, then by activity for each subject.
- The variable names for measurements were not changed, and are the same as specified for the raw data set. The new columns added are :
  --"subject" - denoting the id of the subject performing the action. Range is [1,30]
  --"activities" - denoting the various activities performed by each subject
